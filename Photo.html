  <th> <p class=GN>I took this photo when I was on a field trip to downtown Denver. I quickly snapped the photo of this moped in front of the denver art museum and ran off to join my partner.

  <th> <img class="photography_photo" src="Lense Flare.JPG" alt="A picture of a Lense Flare." </th>
  <th><p class=GN>I took this photo on a hot spring day during the last days of 8th grade year for another project having to do with photography. I noticed that the sun was extremely hot that day and I remember turing and snapping a quick picture before rushing back into the middle school.

  <th> <img class="photography_photo" src="Fence Lense Flare.jpg" alt="A picture of a lense flare against a fence.">
  <th><p class=GN> This photo was also taken for a photography assignment but this time in 7th grade. I took this photo on a hot day in May for a fun project I had. I though the fence was a good representation of prison and the sun represented, well the sun.
